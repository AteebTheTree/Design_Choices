            <!--Okay so a scheduling website. This kind of website intrests me because personally, I'm losing my things
            all the time, and I've always wished that there was a way to keep track of my schedule. Sure there are pre-
            existing methods online, but they're never made by an actual student who knows what the students need in a
            website, just some random guy. I want to cater to the student's with this website-->

            <!--A student aid website, think like Alloprof. This interests me because well. Alloprof is really one of the few
            websites that are great at catering to students, and I thoght "Hey wouldn't it be great if students had somethin-
            g like this but STUDENTS helped out other students? And that's where this idea came from. This 
            one seems out of reach because "Ateeb, how would you 
            store all the accounts and posts" WELL YOURE IN LUCK because I just happen to know server side coding, 
            specifically Google firebase, which when linked with Javascript can be a simple and effective way to make 
            a server based website that can store accounts and posts-->

            <!--(Apply the same thing here to all the account and server stuff)... This one actually sprung from a 
            much simpler idea, I actually really just want to have a website where all of St. Thomas can share their
            creativity and ideas, think a more closed down version of Instagram-->
